# paleoviews

Experiments with creating a high-level, interactive viewing interface for some geoscience data, using existing python tools (mainly geoviews).

Examples so far include:
- Global maps of geophysical data generated using pyshtools
- Plate tectonic reconstructions generated using GPlatesReconstructionModel
